# TUITemplate Starters

Simple, focused tutorial examples for learning TUI development. Start here if you're new to Bubbletea and TUITemplate!

## What Are Starters?

Starters are **small, single-concept examples** designed to teach specific TUI patterns. Each starter:
- Focuses on ONE main concept
- Is easy to understand and modify
- Builds progressively in complexity
- Includes inline comments explaining key decisions

**Looking for complete applications?** Check out [../examples/](../examples/) for full-featured demos.

## Learning Path

### ðŸŸ¢ Beginners (New to TUI development)

1. **Start with `hello/`**
   - Build and run it
   - Read all the code comments
   - Modify the text and colors
   - Try adding your own key bindings

2. **Read the docs**
   - [TUITemplate Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
   - [Usage Guide](../USAGE.md)
   - [Bubbletea Tutorial](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/master/tutorials)

3. **Experiment**
   - Add a counter that increments on key press
   - Add multiple "pages" that switch on different keys
   - Style it with different Lipgloss themes

### ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (Understand basics)

1. **Study `file_browser/`** (when ready)
   - Learn list rendering patterns
   - Understand cursor navigation
   - See how to structure dual-pane layouts

2. **Explore `todo_app/`** (when ready)
   - Learn state management for CRUD
   - Understand view switching
   - See data persistence patterns

3. **Try `log_viewer/`** (when ready)
   - Learn viewport scrolling
   - Understand performance techniques
   - See real-time update patterns

### ðŸ”´ Advanced (Ready for complex patterns)

1. **Analyze `json_viewer/`** (when ready)
   - Complex navigation logic
   - Tree data structures
   - Advanced layout composition

2. **Study `dashboard/`** (when ready)
   - Multi-component orchestration
   - Real-time data flow
   - Advanced state management

3. **Build your own**
   - Use `./scripts/new_project.sh`
   - Check out [../examples/](../examples/) for reference

## Running a Starter

Each starter is self-contained:

```bash
cd <starter-name>
go mod tidy  # Download dependencies
go run .     # Run the app
```

Example:
```bash
cd hello
go mod tidy
go run .
```

## Code Patterns You'll Learn

### State Management
- **Immutable updates** - Never mutate state directly
- **Message-based communication** - Use Bubbletea messages
- **Command pattern** - Async operations return Cmds

### UI Patterns
- **List with cursor** - Up/down navigation with selection
- **Tree navigation** - Expand/collapse hierarchical data
- **Dual-pane layout** - Split screen with focus switching
- **Modal dialogs** - Overlays for user input
- **Status bars** - Fixed headers/footers

### Performance
- **Virtual scrolling** - Only render visible items
- **Lazy loading** - Load data on demand
- **Caching** - Store computed values
- **Debouncing** - Throttle rapid updates

### Architecture
- **Modular files** - Separate concerns (update, view, model)
- **Component composition** - Build complex UIs from simple parts
- **Reusable utilities** - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
